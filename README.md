# hangman
milestone 1 and 2 explanations were uploaded directly onto Github as I was still getting used to using the systems and commiting changes etc. 
Milestone 1 was fairly straightforward in the sense that all a list was created of the possible words in the game. Print statements were used. Milestone 2 is where functions came into actions with the use of the 'def' method where user input was integrated along with the guesses being checked too. 


milestone 3 explanation
The hangman class was set up along with the methods allowing for the parameters to be intitialised. All the attributes were set up using the 'self' instance. The check_guess method was edited to peform actions for if the guess is part of the word. Characters were removed from num_letters. The ask_for_input was also checked for if the input is already in the list of guesses.
